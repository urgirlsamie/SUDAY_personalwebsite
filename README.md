# SUDAY_personalwebsite
This repository was created as part of a Performance Task for our IPT (Information and Programming Technology) subject. It contains the source code and files for my personal portfolio website, which serves as a final output for the topic on front-end web development. 
This project was required to be uploaded to our GitHub accounts as proof of submission and to demonstrate our understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic responsive design. The website includes sections such as a homepage, menu, portfolio section and more. 
It is designed to be mobile-responsive and features a clean layout with custom styling. 
This project features a simple yet functional design that adheres closely to the provided instructions and rubric requirements. 
It focuses on clarity and usability without unnecessary complexity. 
The contact section includes an API integration that handles email and phone number submissions, ensuring users can reach out easily and securely. While minimal in appearance, the project is complete and meets all outlined criteria effectively. 
The primary objective of this task was to apply what we learned in class by building a functional and aesthetically pleasing personal website. This GitHub repository serves both as documentation of my work and as a platform to showcase my learning progress in web development. Thank you and God Bless us all :)
